import UIKit

import FirebaseAuthUI

class LoginViewController: UIViewController {

    /* Tapping the login button will ask user for email & password,
       instead of going through the default FirebaseUI flow (i.e.,
       asking for email and based on whether that address already
       exists for a user, signup or signin).
       At the moment,
       all volunteers go through personal volunteer orientations so
       this is not an issue. When this will change, only the following
       will need to be changed below:

       let rootVC = FUIPasswordSignInViewController(authUI: FUIAuth.defaultAuthUI()!, email: nil)
                  ->FUIEmailEntryViewController<-
     */

     /* Tried to present the `FUIPasswordSignInViewController` as the initial
        screen for the app (i.e., directly from `viewDidLoad` in `ViewController`
        or anywhere from `AppDelegate`), but `FUIAuthDelegate` methods never got
        called once the user have been authenticated.
        See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48012332/

        TODO: dig deeper in FUIAuth.m: `invokeResultCallbackWithAuthDataResult`
              seems to be the key. Many calls are wrapped in `dispatch_async`
              all throughout FirebaseUI's codebase, could be it? (e.g., Matt
              Neuburg mentions this to be used as workarounds for race conditions.
              Check out.)
                                        OR
              Cherry-pick FirebaseUI's codebase and implement it from scratch.
