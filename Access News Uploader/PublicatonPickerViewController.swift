/* HISTORICAL NOTES FOR delegate AND forConfigurationItem (may help later)
   ======================================================

 Implicitly unwrapped optionals are used, because these need to be set
 set for proper functionality.

 //    weak var delegate: ConfigurationItemDelegate!
 //    weak var forConfigurationItem: SLComposeSheetConfigurationItem!

 tl;dr
 The tutorials that pertain to this specific view controller are:
 * http://www.talkmobiledev.com/2017/01/22/create-a-custom-share-extension-in-swift/
 * https://codewithchris.com/uipickerview-example/

 The default share extension pop-up (`SLComposeServiceViewController`) can
 be extended with extra choice menus (`SLComposeSheetConfigurationItem` or
 configuration items; see `lazy var` declarations in `ShareViewController`).

 The configuration item has 3 properties that are relevant here:

 * title (to display what the menu is for)
 * value (that will be updated with a new value after tapping this menu or
 configuration item and choosing/inputing a new value in the subsequent
 view)
 * tapHandler
 It, at least in this app, is used to instantiate and configure
 the subsequent view controller when the menu choice is tapped,
 that will provide the interface to choose a new value. In order
 to exchange data between the view controllers, the stored
 properties below need to be set:

 * `delegate`             - to provide a callback
 * `forConfigurationItem` - it is mostly used to DRY up the code (otherwise
 a new delegate protocol would be necessary for
 every menu choice view controller.

 TODO:                        ^^^ is this assumption correct? ^^^
 TODO: Am I creating a retention cycle as it is implemented right now?

 UPDATE#1: Just realized that delegate may not even be necessary if I am
 going to use `forConfigurationItem` because then the value can
 be set directly.
 Is this a bad idea?

 UPDATE#2: So delegate IS needed (or passing `ShareViewController` instance
 itself) as `popViewController` is not defined in this context. On
 the other hand I also don't like the tight coupling by using
 `forConfigurationItem` stored property.

 -> Make use of `ShareViewController`'s (i.e.,
 `SLComposeServiceViewController`'s) configurationItems:` method?

 UPDATE#3: (1) `popViewController` issues solved by adding `nextConfigurationItemViewController`
 to the `ConfigurationItemDelegate` protocol (now transitions
 can be customized)

 (2) Stayed with `forConfigurationItem` for now. There may be some
 typelevel sorcery with enums and associated types etc., but
 have to have this up and running sooner rather than later.

/* HISTORICAL NOTES #2
 ===================

 Figure out what the difference is between `text` and `insertText`.

 * `text`       is defined by UITextView whereas
 * `insertText` is declared by the UIKeyInput protocol (that is adopted
 by UIResponder, but the fact is never mentioned in the docs)

 See the tutorial and a related SO thread where I commented:
 (1) http://www.talkmobiledev.com/2017/01/22/create-a-custom-share-extension-in-swift/
 (2) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2792589/uitextview-insert-text-in-the-textview-text

 (1) uses `insertText` on a UITextView instance and later calls
 `becomeFirstResponder` on it, so I guess UIKeyInput has to do with it
 based on its description:

 > When instances of this subclass are the first responder,
 > the system keyboard is displayed. Only a small subset of
 > the available keyboards and languages are available to
 > classes that adopt this protocol.
