Notes
=====

`GoogleInfo.plist` is added to the repo, because the final
service will run on another account and anyone finding
this app useful should set up their own Firebase project.

TODO
====

* Extend this README with potential use cases (e.g., with trivial
  modification, this could be used as a personal app to upload files/content
  to Google Storage via Firebase)

* Add a license (currently exclusive copyright applies)
